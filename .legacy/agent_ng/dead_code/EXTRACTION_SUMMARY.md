## üîß Next Steps

1. **Review the extracted code** to ensure nothing important was missed
2. **Run the removal script** with `--dry-run` first to see what would be removed
3. **Execute the removal** with `--remove` to clean up the main codebase
4. **Test the application** to ensure no functionality was broken
5. **Update documentation** to reflect the cleaned codebase

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Notes

- All extracted code is preserved in this directory
- The removal script includes dry-run mode for safety
- Functions can be restored if needed in the future
- No critical functionality should be affected

## üìà Benefits

- **Reduced code complexity** - Easier to maintain and understand
- **Faster builds** - Less code to compile and process
- **Cleaner codebase** - Focus on actively used code
- **Better performance** - Reduced memory footprint
- **Easier debugging** - Less noise in the codebase

## üöÄ Usage

To remove the dead code from the main codebase:

```bash
# Dry run (see what would be removed)
python .legacy/agent_ng/dead_code/remove_dead_code.py --dry-run

# Actually remove the dead code
python .legacy/agent_ng/dead_code/remove_dead_code.py --remove
```

## üìù Maintenance

This directory should be reviewed periodically to:
- Check if any extracted code is needed again
- Remove truly obsolete code after a grace period
- Update the removal script if new dead code is found
