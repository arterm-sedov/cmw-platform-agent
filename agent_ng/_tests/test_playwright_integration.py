Test script demonstrating Playwright MCP tools integration.

This script shows how to use the Playwright MCP tools that are now configured
in your Cursor IDE for browser automation tasks.

Once the MCP server is properly connected, you'll have access to these tools:
- mcp_Playwright_browser_navigate
- mcp_Playwright_browser_click  
- mcp_Playwright_browser_type
- mcp_Playwright_browser_screenshot
- mcp_Playwright_browser_snapshot
- mcp_Playwright_browser_wait_for
