# Error Handling Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the improvements made to error handling in the CMW Platform Agent to provide meaningful error responses instead of generic "No answer provided" messages.

## Problem

Previously, when tools executed successfully but the LLM failed (e.g., due to context length limits), users would see "No answer provided" instead of meaningful error information. This made debugging difficult and hid valuable information about what actually happened.

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in Tool Calling Loop

**File**: `agent_ng/langchain_memory.py`

- Added try-catch blocks around LLM invocations
- Preserve tool execution context when LLM errors occur
- Provide specific error messages for context length limits

### 2. New Meaningful Response Function

**File**: `agent_ng/utils.py`

Added `ensure_meaningful_response()` function that:
- Preserves tool execution context
- Identifies likely causes of failures (context length limits)
- Provides actionable error information

### 3. Improved Streaming Response Handling

**File**: `agent_ng/langchain_agent.py`

- Updated streaming to use meaningful response function
- Preserves error context in streaming responses

## Key Improvements

### Before
```
No answer provided
```

### After
```
Tools executed successfully (list_templates, list_attributes) but response is empty. This may indicate a context length limit or processing error.
```

## Error Scenarios Handled

1. **Context Length Limits**: When tools succeed but LLM fails due to token limits
2. **Tool Execution Errors**: When individual tools fail
3. **LLM Processing Errors**: When LLM fails to generate responses
4. **Empty Responses**: When LLM returns empty content

## Benefits

- **Better Debugging**: Users can see what tools executed successfully
- **Context Preservation**: Error messages include relevant context
- **Actionable Information**: Users understand what went wrong and why
- **Maintained Architecture**: Changes are modular and traceable

## Testing

The improvements are tested in `misc_files/test_error_handling_improvements.py` which verifies:
- Error message generation
- Tool context preservation
- Realistic error scenarios

## Usage

The improvements are automatically applied throughout the agent system. No changes to existing code are required - the improvements are backward compatible and enhance existing functionality.

## Files Modified

- `agent_ng/utils.py` - Added `ensure_meaningful_response()` function
- `agent_ng/langchain_memory.py` - Enhanced error handling in tool calling loop
- `agent_ng/langchain_agent.py` - Updated streaming to use meaningful responses
- `misc_files/test_error_handling_improvements.py` - Test suite for improvements

## Architecture Compliance

All changes maintain the existing modular, traceable, lean, and DRY architecture:
- Functions are focused and single-purpose
- Error handling is centralized in utility functions
- Changes are minimal and targeted
- No code duplication introduced
